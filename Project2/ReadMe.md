For Project #2 I have created a script to inform the user of the current time on their local machine.  Along with that information,  I have also added a greeting for the user to view.  Depending on the time, the user is greeted with "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon" & "Good Evening".

This Script idea was inspired by Project #1 guidelines and I referred to - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-current-date-and-time-using-python/ - for python assistance.

There is no user input needed, just run the script in order to get the results neccessary.
