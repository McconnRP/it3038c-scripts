**Project 3 - Final Project**

**PasswordGenProject**

For my Final Project I have created a Python Script with the purpose of creating a strong password.  With technology today, having a strong password is essential to keeping the user safe and secure when it comes to their personal information.  A huge issue in account creation and sensitive information breaches is the caused by weak and overused passwords.  The goal of my project was to create something useful that would allows users to have some options when it comes to creating secure passwords.  

My script contains 3 options for the user...

1. Randomly Generated Password - Allowing the user to determine the amount of characters
2. Category Based Password - Relate your password to something that the user may usually use
3. User Input Password - Allowing the user to create their own password with an additional security measure

How to Run:
1. Copy the code from PasswordGenProject.py
2. Paste in any program that can execute Python Script
3. Run Script
4. Follow Instructions as they are presented
   - If the user is unhappy with the password output, they are able to rerun the generator at the end of the process
5. Use safe generated password!

   Inspiration for this Project is dedicated to 101Computing.Net
